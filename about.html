      <h5>Skills</h5>
      <p>React, Angular, Node.js, C#, SQL.</p>
      <h5>Why coding?</h5>
      <p>
        I had been working in the health industry for around 8 years and had
        been toying with the idea of software development for a few years before
        joining northcoders. My main reason for moving on from health coaching
        was that I wanted a new type of challenge. Coding had been on my radar
        as I had set my own wordpress site up for my nutrition coaching business
        and dabbled very mildy in html, css and dns.
        <br /><br />
        After a few online coding courses I signed up to Northcoders for a
        December 2018 start. Northcoders was a 12 week coding bootcamp focused
        on full stack Javascript. I can safely say that Northcoders was one of
        the hardest things I have ever done. Mostly due to the amount of content
        delivered and the intensity of the course.
        <br />
        <br />
        Receiving my first job offer two weeks after the end of the course
        proved to me the power of a well delivered course and trusting in the
        process.
        <br /><br />
        Moving into coding has been one of the best decisions I have made. I
        love the problem solving, the chance to create and the continual
        learning.
        <h5>My ambition</h5>
        <p>To delve deeper into full stack development, continue to challenge myself and build new and more complex software.</p>
