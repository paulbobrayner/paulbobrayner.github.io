      <h5>What</h5>
      <p>
        This was a group task where we had less than 2 weeks to come up with an
        idea and present the idea at graduation. Unfortunately we did not have
        time to deploy the app. <br />
        <br />
        Ramble is a group trip organising App, which incorporates a chat bot to
        build your itinerary for you. You can talk to the chatbot to add key
        elements to your trip such as dates, location. There is a function to
        add your friends to a trip and a group chat where you can chat with your
        friends on that trip. You can have multiple trips. <br />
        <br />
        My main focus was on the front end, so working with React-Native,
        creating API calls, incorporating the group chat function and chat bot.
